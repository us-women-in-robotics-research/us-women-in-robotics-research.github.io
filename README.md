## FAQ

Q. Why do you not include {group/country/positions}?
A. This website was created and updated by PhD students from the Interaction Lab. We would love to add in more people but the problem becomes intractable for us to monitor and update when doing so.

Q. Why did X person not get on the list?
A. We search for the person on the web, typically first using their provided website. The qualifications for the list are having a PhD and currently in an academic position (e.g., Professor, Postdoctoral Researcher) doing robotics research.

Q. Do you have a list of robotics topics?
A. Yes! We have a specific list in the repo of robotics topics. This will never be all encompassing (robotics is a huge discipline) but you can also check out all of the topics by each researcher in the list.
